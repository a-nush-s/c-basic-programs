this program will create a linked list, first printing the number of integers in the list, then the list itself. 
in the input .txt file, you can list all numbers you want added (with an "i" before the number) or removed (with a "d" before 
the number) from the list. e.g. (view in code) 
i 10
i 12
d 10 
i 5
this will print:
2
5 12
